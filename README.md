# Plex-Tidal-DL
Plex supports Tidal integration, and this is a simple script that checks for favorited Tidal albums. If any albums have been favorited, then this script will start another program called Tidal-DL to download them. After downloading the albums, the Plex library will be updated automatically.

This script is designed to run continuously, and it checks for recently added albums every 30 minutes. If no albums are found, the script will simply continue without updating your Plex library.

Note: The Tidal app is NOT needed for this. All you need is a Plex server with a Tidal subscription, Python 3, and [Tidal-DL](https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader)
