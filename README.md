# Plex-Tidal-DL
Plex supports Tidal integration, and this is a simple script that checks for favorited Tidal albums. If any albums have been favorited, then this script will start another program called Tidal-DL to download those albums. After downloading the albums, the Plex library will be updated automatically.
